# Shot classification

- Dataset from [link](https://anyirao.com/projects/ShotType.html)
- Framework used [sprintdl](https://github.com/SubhadityaMukherjee/sprintdl)
        - A note: Yes I am using a custom library. But everything I do will be properly documented so you can directly translate it to your own. (Eg: architecture, procedures etc)
